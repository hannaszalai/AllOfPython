# PythonGettingStarted

## First description
This project encompassed a series of programming tasks focusing on fundamental concepts such as iteration, functions, and simulations. Through these tasks, I practiced various skills including basic programming constructs, algorithmic problem-solving, and data manipulation. Additionally, I gained proficiency in utilizing Python's standard libraries and implementing mathematical and logical operations in code. Key components of the project included tasks like summing even numbers, finding primes, computing distances between points, and simulating random walks, among others. These exercises enhanced my understanding of Python programming fundamentals, algorithm design, and problem-solving techniques, contributing to my overall skill development in computer science and software development.

## Second description
This project involved tasks related to file input and output (I/O), data manipulation, and data structure implementation. Through these tasks, I honed skills in file handling, data processing, and class implementation in Python. Key components of the project included creating programs to interact with directories and files, analyzing text data, and implementing data structures like deques. These exercises enhanced my understanding of Python's built-in functions for file operations, string manipulation, and data structure design. Additionally, I gained proficiency in using Python's standard libraries effectively to accomplish various tasks efficiently. Overall, the project provided valuable hands-on experience in working with real-world data and implementing fundamental programming concepts.

## Mini-project description
I worked on a project focusing on hashing and binary search trees in Python. The project was divided into three main tasks: firstly, I used Python's set and dictionary classes to count unique words and identify the top 10 most frequent words in two large text files. Secondly, I implemented custom hash-based set and binary search tree-based map data structures. Finally, I repeated the initial task using my custom implementations while also analyzing the performance metrics of these structures when handling the large text files. Overall, the project aimed to deepen my understanding of data structures and their applications in efficiently handling text data.
